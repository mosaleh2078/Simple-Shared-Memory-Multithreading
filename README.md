# Simple-Shared-Memory-Multithreading

On of the basic principles in multithread programming is threads communication (or IPC), and the basic form of this communication is *Shared Memory*. In this program I practiced this method in Python. I wrote two classes: 
1. Random Producer
2. Array multiplication
The first class just generate random numbers between 1 to 100 and put them into shared memory and the second class multiply these values to a list which contains 0<sup>2</sup> to 9<sup>2</sup>.
